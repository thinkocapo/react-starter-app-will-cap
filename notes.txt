1.
already has webpack? babel?
looks like DOES NOT come with WEBPACK......?

npm install

npm install webpack?

comes with the following:
https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction
react react-dom react-bootstrap

2. react-scripts
installed 'react-scripts' because it adds a node_modules/.bin react-scripts binary which then looks for src/index.js and a public/html
so had to remake a src/index.js (from src/index.jsx due to other tutorial) and public/index.html (it was in ./index.html not ./public/index.html)



TODO
Redux
React-router
Material UI (make available, maybe make an alternative front-end route that features it)
Test a back-end REST API endpoint
